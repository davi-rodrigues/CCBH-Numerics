# CCBH-PLPP

## `Notebooks_in_wl_format` folder

This folder provides the standard notebooks in plain text (wl) format. This is convenient for human reading or executing the CCBH-PLPP code without full Mathematica.

To execute it in a Jupyter notebook use [Mathematica Engine](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/) and [Wolfram Language for Jupyter](https://github.com/WolframResearch/WolframLanguageForJupyter).
