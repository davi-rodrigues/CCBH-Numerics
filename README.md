# Cosmological Coupled Black Holes and the power-law-plus-peak distribution (CCBH-PLPP)

Davi C. Rodrigues (UFES, Brazil & Heidelberg University, Germany)

This code was used for the paper `Constraints on cosmologically coupled black holes from gravitational wave observations and minimal formation mass` by Amendola, Rodrigues, Kumar & Quartin (arXiv XXXXX). It was used in all PLPP-method applications, which is the method based on the power-law-plus-peak distribution [..].  See also XXXXX for the Direct method code.



In the paper you can find explanations on the physical context.
